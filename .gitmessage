# <type>(<optional scope>): <description>
# 
# [optional body]
# 
# [optional footer(s)]

# The commit contains the following structural elements, to communicate intent
# to the consumers of your library:
#
# * fix: a commit of the type fix patches a bug in your codebase (this
#   correlates with PATCH in Semantic Versioning).
# * feat: a commit of the type feat introduces a new feature to the
#   codebase (this correlates with MINOR in Semantic Versioning).
# * BREAKING CHANGE: a commit that has a footer BREAKING CHANGE:, or
#   appends a ! after the type/scope, introduces a breaking API change
#   (correlating with MAJOR in Semantic Versioning). A BREAKING CHANGE can
#   be part of commits of any type.
# * types other than fix: and feat: are allowed: [build:, chore:, ci:,
#   docs:, style:, refactor:, perf:, test:, revert:].
# * footers other than `BREAKING CHANGE: <description>` may be provided
#   and follow a convention similar to git trailer format.
